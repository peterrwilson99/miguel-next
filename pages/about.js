              A fifth-year computer engineering student with a year of extensive
              experience in product development, especially within the realm of
              hardware and firmware. Through his experience working with
              Ergonomyx Technologies, he has unparalleled leadership skills
              which led to the development of a new unreleased product for the
              company. He is currently working with his club, UVEEC, as
              co-founder, to design and manufacture all the electronics on the
              clubâ€™s USV. He is also working on designing an underwater acoustic
              pinger for his old club AUVIC, and is currently building his own
              open source programmable electronic load as a personal project.
              Miguel has a passion for electronics and technology, especially 3D
              printing, PCB design, and PC building. In his free time, Miguel is
              an avid weightlifter, enthusiastic soccer player, and loves to
              play competitive video games.

                  Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on over a
                  dozen amazing projects and teams that have shaped me into the
                  engineer I am today. From hardware to mechanical projects, I
                  have been blessed to widen my skills through the experiences
                  I've gained from these teams.
