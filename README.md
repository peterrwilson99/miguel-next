# Miguel's Portfolio

Portfolio for Miguel Manguerra for future job opportunities and a place to reflect on past work. 

The overall tools used as follows:

- React and JavaScript for language
- Vercel for Deployment
- NextJS Routing and Rendering
- MaterialUI for components
- TailwindCSS for styles (Barely used at all, essentially only using padding and text sizing classes)

Node and npm must be installed. Once installed run the following commands.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
