        "description": "Currently building a Smart Power Distribution Board that was designed to power the USV's electronics (BLDC motors, Central Controller Board, Raspberry Pi, etc.) while protecting against reverse voltage and overcurrent faults. The power drawn by external electronics were also measured alongside the health and status of the batteryâ€™s cells. An emergency shutdown feature was also implemented to manually shutdown the entire USV with one click of a button.",
