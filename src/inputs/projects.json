        "description": "Worked with Salyx Medical to develop a custom Blood Pressure Emulator to test their Vitals Monitoring device. A custom built PCB was designed to receive feedback from flow and pressure sensors while driving two peristaltic pumps via stepper motor drivers. Led the design of the mechanical system to safely house all the electronics, tubing, and motors. Assisted with the development of the artifical limb and the testing of the PCB as well.",

        "description": "Designed and programmed an automated battery tester to test LIR2450 batteries for Ergonomyx. The tester integrated a battery charging IC to charge the battery and a programmable load to set the discharge current of both batteries. Then when testing begins, the device charges the batteries to full and when charge is complete, begins discharging both batteries through the load resistors. This tester would automatically monitor the discharge current, discharge cycles, battery voltage, battery temperature, and the discharge time of both batteries and store all the data in a micro SD card. After testing is complete, the data on the micro SD card can be outputted to an excel sheet for further analysis.",
